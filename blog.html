                    <h4>Q4OS 3.8 Centaurus, stable</h4>
                    15 July, 2019
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce the immediate availability of the brand new stable Q4OS 3.8 version,
                        codenamed 'Centaurus'. This is a long-term support LTS release, to be supported for at least
                        five years with security patches and software updates.<br />
                        <br />
                        The primary Q4OS aim is stability. As we want to provide as stable as possible operating system
                        for companies as well as for individuals, once installed and configured, Q4OS will work reliably
                        in a long standing way, getting security fixes and updates. Adopting a new feature into the core
                        system could be committed in a highly exceptional cases only. We treat such possible cases as
                        best as possible, doing testing and investigating consequences carefully before such a
                        change.<br />
                        <br />
                        Q4OS Centaurus is based on Debian Buster 10 and Plasma 5.14, optionally Trinity 14.0.6, desktop
                        environment, and it's available for 64bit and 32bit/i686pae computers, as well as for older i386
                        systems without PAE extension. We are working hard to bring it for ARM devices too.<br />
                        <br />
                        One of the Q4OS specific goals is the ability to have Plasma and Trinity desktop alongside each
                        other installed. Users can switch back and forth between more advanced Plasma or efficient
                        Trinity desktop. Both desktops can independently coexist side by side and don't interfere with
                        each other. Plasma is being the logical primary choice for most of users, so it's considered to
                        be the default option, which is also obvious from the Q4OS downloads site.<br />
                        <br />
                        We are coming with our own exclusive utilities and features, especially with the 'Desktop
                        profiler' for profiling your computer into different professional working tools, 'Setup utility'
                        for the smooth installation of third-party applications, a 'Welcome Screen' with several
                        integrated shortcuts to make system configuration easier for novice users, LXQT, XFCE and LXDE
                        alternative environments installation scripts and many more. As installed, a user gets a minimal
                        system with possibility to expand it, no other operating system features a tool like Q4OS's
                        Desktop profiler.<br />
                        <br />
                        The Desktop profiler does more then desktop environments installation. Its primary purpose is to
                        offer "application profiles", a set of predefined applications, and install them easily in a
                        single click. A .deb as well as .esh package format is supported. Packages can be defined as cpu
                        architecture, as well as desktop environment, dependable. In addition, each desktop environment
                        may keep its own applications profiles. A user can even create customized profiles on his
                        own.<br />
                        <br />
                        Enjoy Q4OS and feel free to download installation media images from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads section</a> of the Q4OS website.

                    <h4>Q4OS 3.7 Centaurus, testing</h4>
                    15 June, 2019
                    <p>
                        We are entering the final phase of the Q4OS 3 Centaurus development, so it's now officially
                        frozen. On this occasion we have released a brand new 32bit Q4OS Centaurus installation media
                        designed for older computers, as well as 64bit media cumulative update. Users can now easily
                        deploy the Q4OS 3.7 testing release, if they want to become early adopters or just help with the
                        testing. Please download 64bit, as well as 32bit iso images on the dedicated <a href="downloads.html">Testing releases</a> webpage.<br />
                        <br />
                        Please note, there is also a Q4OS for Windows installer on the downloads page available for
                        users who want to install Linux from within Windows as easy as an application, even without need
                        of partitioning.<br />
                        <br />
                        The Freeze phase is now in effect for Q4OS 3 Centaurus, which means that no new features, nor
                        significant changes are permitted, exception making only critical bugs and anything else, that
                        might block the final release. Now that Q4OS 3 Centaurus is frozen, it won't be long until the
                        final release is announced. It should become stable on about 6th July 2019, it's the next major
                        Q4OS release based on the acclaimed Debian operating system and will be supported at least five
                        years from the official release date.

                    <h4>Q4OS 2.7 Scorpion, stable</h4>
                    31 December, 2018
                    <p>
                        A significant update to the Q4OS 2 Scorpion stable LTS is immediately available for download. The
                        new 2.7 series brings some important improvements for the Trinity desktop. An essential change
                        is much improved scaling ability for hi-dpi screens, making this operating system better adapted
                        for modern computers. Desktop profiler, Software centre, Welcome screen, Setup utility, and
                        other Q4OS specific tools have been updated to be rendered correctly for higher screen
                        resolutions. Apart from the scaling capabilities, Q4OS 2.7 brings numerous improvements and
                        fixes, for example better GTK3 themes integration, fixes to XDG standard implementation and
                        others.<br />
                        <br />
                        Current users only need to perform regular update of their systems to activate scaling
                        capabilities, however we recommend for new users to download and make a fresh Q4OS 2.7
                        installation. Other changes include Q4OS installer improvements, Firefox 64 and LibreOffice
                        6.1.3 installers, important security and bug fixes as well as cumulative upgrade covering all
                        changes since the previous Q4OS 2 Scorpion stable release. You can download installation media
                        images from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads section</a> of the Q4OS website.

                    <h4>Q4OS 3.4 Centaurus, testing</h4>
                    22 September, 2018
                    <p>
                        A significant update to the Q4OS Centaurus testing version is available for download, you can
                        find 64bit iso image at the dedicated <a href="downloads.html">Testing releases</a> site.
                        Anybody is invited to try it out and report bugs and glitches.<br />
                        <br />
                        This release brings quite significant changes and improvements, the most important one is that
                        Q4OS switched to the Calamares installer. That offers nice new installation features, for
                        example fully encrypt target system, easy disk drive partitioning and many others. Another
                        important change is move to the new Trinity 14.0.6 development version. All dependencies from
                        the current stable Q4OS Scorpion has been removed, so the Centaurus now becomes fully
                        independent getting its own repositories and dependencies. Secure boot support has been improved
                        too. The Calamares installer detects, if secure boot is active and adjusts the target system
                        accordingly. If secure boot is switched off in the firmware, no Secure boot stuff is
                        installed.<br />
                        <br />
                        Q4OS Centaurus 3.4 is based on the current Debian 'Buster' and Trinity desktop 14.0.6
                        development branches. Q4OS Centaurus will be in development until Debian Buster becomes stable,
                        and will be supported at least five years from the official release date.

                    13 August, 2018
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce a new major stable release of the Q4OS 2.5 Scorpion ARM port, optimized
                        for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> series of single board
                        computers. It is based on the latest stable Raspbian Stretch distribution and Trinity desktop
                        R14.0.5 version. Q4OS is one of a few distributions offering the full desktop environment on the
                        ARM architecture.<br />
                        <br />
                        Feel free to download the Q4OS RPI image from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads section</a>
                        of the Q4OS website and install it on a SD card, please read the <a href="dqa010.html">Installation guide</a>. It's possible to buy preinstalled SD card in our

                        Trinity desktop environment as an option. Anyone is welcome to download from the Q4OS <a href="downloads.html">Downloads site</a>.

                    <h4>Q4OS 2.5 Scorpion, stable</h4>
                    03 June, 2018
                    <p>
                        A significant update to the Q4OS 2 Scorpion stable LTS is immediately available for download. The
                        new 2.5 series brings an essential change adding KDE Plasma to be an equal option to the Trinity
                        desktop, as Q4OS is now pre-configured for both desktops to coexist alongside each other. System
                        installer configures the system the usual way, but decides afterwards to offer additional
                        installation of the KDE Plasma desktop, if sufficient hardware resources detected. So a user can
                        login and switch forth and back between lightweight efficient Trinity desktop and more advanced
                        KDE Plasma desktop environment according to his choice.<br />
                        <br />
                        Other changes include PulseAudio better system integration for easier audio management, Q4OS
                        installer improvements, Firefox 60 and LibreOffice 6 installers, important security and bug
                        fixes as well as cumulative upgrade covering all changes since the previous Q4OS 2 Scorpion
                        stable release. You can download installation media images from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads section</a> of the Q4OS website.

                    <h4>Windows 10 loves Linux, Windows 10 loves Debian, Q4OS loves Windows 10</h4>
                    29 November, 2017
                    <p>
                        We are happy to introduce a first stable release of the Q4OS for Windows 10 installer. It allows
                        everyone to install Q4OS alongside Windows in an easy way, with no need of modifying an existing
                        Windows operating system, nor any of software installed, even with no need of repartitioning
                        your disk drive. Simply download and run Q4OS installer, just like any other Windows
                        application, and follow the installer instructions. The installer will install and configure
                        your computer to be able to run Q4OS or Windows 10 in a dual boot mode. Once you perform the
                        setup, you will be able to switch back and forth between Windows and Q4OS each time you restart
                        your computer. This installer is compatible with Windows 10, as well as 7 and 8 version, and
                        it's able to use Secure boot feature, if available in the PC firmware. Secure boot will allow
                        you to boot Q4OS in a smooth and safe way.<br />
                        <br />
                        The installer is immediately available for download from the <a href="downloads.html">
                            Downloads
                            section
                        </a> of the Q4OS website, however we would recommend everyone to read installation
                        notes first, please see <a href="dqa014.html">Q4OS documentation</a>.<br />
                        <br />
                        You will be able to remove Q4OS at any time using an integrated uninstaller. The uninstaller
                        completely erases the Q4OS installation, so your computer will be reverted into its original
                        status as before installation.<br />
                        <br />
                        If your Windows becomes lagging, it's the right time to try Q4OS out, a lightweight, snappy and
                        easy to use operating system with variety of applications available in repositories. Q4OS is not
                        intended to be a replacement, but the perfect complement to an existing Windows installation.

                        The new Q4OS 'Orion' 1.8.4 stable release is out to implement several improvements and fixes. The

                        while we intend to support it thoroughly in the Q4OS 'Scorpion' edition. Icedove messaging
                        application is no more available by the Q4OS installer, as it has been replaced by the real
                        Thunderbird 45.8 release.<br />
                        <br />

                        stable Debian base. All mentioned updates are immediately available for existing Q4OS users from

                    <h4>X2Go bugfix update</h4>
                    26 May, 2015
                    <p>
                        X2Go Server has been updated to fix the bug causing Server start crash on some platforms. The bug
                        is related only to Q4OS versions 1.2.x 'Orion' with X2Go Server installation. Admins are
                        encouraged to install the new X2Go Server release, the best way is to use Software Centre. The
                        buggy version of the X2Go Server has to be uninstalled first with the terminal command:<br />
                        $ dash /usr/share/apps/q4os_system/uninst_q4inf/uninstall_x2goserver-q4.esh

                        applications much easier. We plan an important option for the Software Centre, which would allow
                        direct purchasing of non-free applications and installing them in Q4OS seamlessly. The other
                        notable change coming with the new Q4OS release is completion of several Welcome Screen
                        translations, thanks to excellent work of external translators from different countries. A few
